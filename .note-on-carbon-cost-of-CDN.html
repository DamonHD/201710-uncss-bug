<p>
2017/05/11: I am trying to understand if moving some of my
(lightly loaded and fairly static) Web sites into the cloud c/o CDNs
can improve perceived performance, with use of features
such as HTTP/2, and whether I'm likely to be making a difference to my
total carbon impact in the process.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, I can make users happy with faster sites,
and also reduce my carbon footprint through improved efficiency.
</p>

<p>
I'm nowhere near any bandwidth or capacity limits,
nor have any of my sites been attacked (more than the usual background),
so this is in the spirit of scientific enquiry!
</p>

<p>
Most of my views are single page (eg via search) and from the same country
(UK), thus low latency/RTT (Round-Trip Time between the user and my servers).
</p>


<h2>First View, Empty Cache</h2>

<p>
Improving user experience is therefore quite a lot about reducing the
"first page view" page load time of a new user with an empty cache.
</p>

<p>
Speedup may also help search engine optimisation (yes, the deaded SEO)
ie help my pages to be spidered and returned in search results!
</p>

<p>
(My general approach remains to cache like it was going out of fashion,
but optimise for the first hit and assume near 100% bounce rate anyway!)
</p>

<p>
Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/mobile">Mobile Analysis in PageSpeed Insights</a> suggests that above-the-fold (ATF) content should render in no more than 1s.
</p>

<p>
Though new and shiny and fashionable, the pros and cons of HTTP/2
seem quite subtle for smaller sites for example, with findings such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/using-http-2-responsibly-adapting-for-users">If your site’s footprint is very small, HTTP requests are few, and upgrading to SSL isn’t pragmatic, you may already be well-served by HTTP/1</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7476672/"> ... for networks with higher RTTs, HTTP/2 has better energy consumption performance than HTTP/1.1</a> [<a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?url=http://softwareprocess.es/pubs/chowdhury2016SANER-http2.pdf&hl=en&sa=X&scisig=AAGBfm2u6039_ST1gZalHEx6rbT0EX4V8A&nossl=1&oi=scholarr&ved=0ahUKEwiU3NXO65PUAhUIAsAKHfP5BfsQgAMIJygAMAA">PDF</a>].</li>
<li><a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/2027.pdf">Web Servers Energy Efficiency Under HTTP/2: Varun Sapra and Abram Hindle [PDF]</a>: "We conclude that even with huge TLS associated cost with HTTP/2, on high latency networks it can help servers to be more energy efficient while improving their performance as well."</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>It seems that for lightweight sites near their end users (eg all
within one country) neither CDNs nor HTTP/2 seem likely to help with
either speed or bandwidth (nor likely cost, energy and thus carbon)</em>:
see below.
</p>

<p>
Note that there are some things that can be done which are pretty
much always a win for performance and carbon, such as lossless
reduction of HTML/JavaScript/CSS (minifying) and images, though
sometimes there is a conflict with maintainability of the site.
</p>


<h2>Target</h2>

<p>
First, I want to measure if HTTP/2 helps perceived site performance
at all given the nature of the site and users, and inspite of any
https/TLS costs, simply because of better use of TCP (eg, a single
connection).  Time to first render, and time to be 'visually complete'
of essential content above the fold, are probably good candidate
metrics.
</p>

<p>
Second, I want to estimate nominal carbon cost or savings
from offloading some load into highly-tuned CDN engines in the
cloud.  This could include reduced travel distance for traffic,
reduced numbers of connections or packets or bytes sent might all
be a reasonable start.
</p>


<h2>Fossil Site</h2>

<p>
For this test I have ab/used a 'fossil' site that I use for one
very narrow purpose (remembering which agents I have used for
contracting in London and sharing that list with others).
</p>

<p>
It is basically a single relatively small HTML (~10kB) page with
three small decorative images, being served from my Raspberry Pi 2
with Apache 2.2 over HTTP/1.1 unencrypted over a nice fat (~10Mbps
outbound) FTTC (Fibre To The Cabinet) Internet link.
</p>

<p>
Traffic is tiny, and most of it is bots of some sort!
</p>

<p>
Typical human users are from the UK (the domain is .co.uk).
</p>

<p>
When I use the magnificent <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest</a>
to fetch a broadly similar page from the same server (this page
in fact, while being written) to a UK location to a desktop over
'DSL' (London, UK - EC2 - Chrome - DSL; 1.5Mbps/384kbps 50ms RTT),
fetching twice to a fresh browser cache to simulate a typical first
visit from a new user but with any intermediate hardware warmed up,
<a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/170512_RE_DAD/">I get</a>
for run 2:

<p>
That's lots of 'A' scores and the following initial (HTML) connection details:
</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS Lookup: 60 ms</li>
<li>Initial Connection: 70 ms</li>
<li>Time to First Byte: 116 ms</li>
<li>Content Download: 15 ms</li>
<li>Bytes In (downloaded): 3.7 KB</li>
<li>Uncompressed Size: 7.6 KB</li>
<li>Bytes Out (uploaded): 0.4 KB</li>
</ul>
<p>
That is a time to first byte of ~100ms and from above a visually complete
document in well under a second, which is all very good!
</p>

<p>
A couple of (HTTP/1.1) connections are opened, the second speculatively
by the browser, the first transferring 3 objects and the second used for 2.
</p>

<div class="fullwcdisp">
<img src="//STATIC.earth.org.uk/img/20170512-waterfall-non-CDN.png" class="resp" width="930" height="261" title="connection chart c/o WebPagetest" alt="connection chart c/o WebPagetest" />
</div>

<p>
So this is a case where HTTP/1.1 is performing quite well.
</p>

<p>
The (fossil, and this peer) site content is entirely benign so there
isn't a very strong case for encryption, and given the very low traffic
any effort spent on managing https is arguably wasted.  Opinions vary.
</p>


<h2>Testing HTTP/2 Easily: Cloudflare</h2>

<p>
To test HTTP/2 with mainline browsers requires a secure connection
<a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#does-http2-require-encryption">in practice</a>
because there are a lot of broken HTTP/1.x proxies out there.  My
current RPi2 installation is such that I'd have to reinstall the
OS from scratch to get the Apache 2.4 and OpenSSL and other support
needed: <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> is not going to get me
there.
</p>

<p>
I do use some CDN tech with another of my Web sites, in a model
where I push heavily-used static site furniture (thumbnails) in
advance to the CDN for a non-static site, but that required significant
coding effort and even breaking out the coporate credit card.  Too
heavyweight for a quick feasibility test...
</p>

<p>
I found out that <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>
offers a reverse-proxy model, that it can do this reverse proxying
for existing non-secure sites, and that there is a free tier for
piddling sites such as mine.  And Cloudflare creates and manages all
the relevant certificates too.  Hurrah!
</p>

<p>
The main effort was switching the DNS delegtion for the domain
to Cloudflare and waiting for old records to time out, but
while I was having fun I tidied up the HTML, shunk the (minor)
site graphics with on and off-line tools (TinyPNG and OptiPNG),
and turned on some extra Cloudflare optimisations suitable for
my <em>very</em> static site (years between updates).
</p>

<p>
I satisfied myself that everything worked as I wanted,
and then stepped back to test things more systematically.
</p>


<h2>Blank Page HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2</h2>

<p>
A first really basic test is to create a zero-length HTML file
and try to load it through the HTTP/1.1 and HTTPS + HTTP/2 URLs
to compare speed, number of connections, etc.
</p>

<p>
Cloudflare's "Cache Everything" option is was turned on, relevant to
this test, so that the (empty) HTML page would be served directly from
Cloudflare, without trying to go back to my server.  I also have long
time timeouts (~1 month) in Cloudflare and all the Expires/Cache-Control
headers, to ensure the first visit is fast (served from the CDN) and
subsequent visits faster still since the brower should be able to retain
everything in its cache.
</p>

<p>
For the HTTP/1.1 time to first byte is typically 185ms, with
DNS very similar to the non-CDN case of 60ms.  In this case a second,
speculative, connection was opened by the browser, and in the end was
used to attempt to fetch the site favicon.ico, but there isn't one,
so this averaged 0.5 useful objects per TCP connection.
</p>

<p>
Here is more detail on one sample primary connection:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Request Start: 0.113 s</li>
<li>DNS Lookup: 59 ms</li>
<li>Initial Connection: 54 ms</li>
<li>Time to First Byte: 75 ms</li>
<li>Content Download: 0 ms</li>
<li>Bytes In (downloaded): 0.5 KB</li>
<li>Uncompressed Size: 20 B</li>
<li>Bytes Out (uploaded): 0.4 KB</li>
</ul>

<p>
The similar DNS time to my own site and DNS managed on my primaries
and secondaries suggests that even Cloudflare's world-class DNS doesn't
out-do my own in this simple case where clients are close by.
</p>

<p>
For HTTP/2 (and https) the time to first byte is around 300ms,
including similar DNS time to before.  Here is a little more detail:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Request Start: 0.235 s</li>
<li>DNS Lookup: 59 ms</li>
<li>Initial Connection: 54 ms</li>
<li>SSL Negotiation: 93 ms</li>
<li>Time to First Byte: 70 ms</li>
<li>Content Download: 0 ms</li>
<li>Bytes In (downloaded): 0.3 KB</li>
<li>Uncompressed Size: 20 B</li>
<li>Certificates (downloaded): 3757 B</li>
<li>Bytes Out (uploaded): 0.2 KB</li>
</ul>

<p>
The extra https/TLS overhead (time and bytes) is noticeable in this
rather extreme case.  At least HTTP/2 avoided opening up another
connection.
</p>


<h3 id=StatusCake>StatusCake</h3>

<p>
Update 2017/07/28:
c/o of the nice people at <a href="https://www.statuscake.com/">StatusCake</a>
(thank you Dan and the dev team) I compared a zero-byte HTML page served:
</p>
<ul>
<li>From the fossil site via Cloudflare over http: and HTTP/1.1: ~69ms.</li>
<li>From the fossil site via Cloudflare over https: and SPDY: ~85ms.</li>
<li>From the mobile version of this site over http: and HTTP/1.1: ~80ms.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The StatusCake test servers used for this test  are in the UK, as is my server,
and Cloudflare has UK POPs at least in London and Manchester.
</p>

<p>
This is in line with the previous data that even a super-fast CDN and
a transport newer than HTTP/1.1 doesn't compensate for the TLS overhead.
</p>


<h2>Ad-Free Page HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2</h2>

<p>
Next I constructed a slightly cut-down version of the real main page,
still with the bulk of its HTML, all its images, but for example no ads.
</p>

<p>
Note that in Cloudflare there is an option to auto-minify HTML (and
CSS and JavaScript) which is effectively lossless compression.  I have
enabled it, and it is relevant to this test.
</p>

<p>
There is a little extra whitespace to help quickly manually edit this
file when I update it (old school vi; no CMS here!).  Cloudflare is able
to remove most of it automatically.
</p>

<p>
Note that Cloudflare will also serve the content compressed with gzip if
the browser will accept that encoding, which along with the minifying
results in minimising the number of bytes sent over the network to
achieve the desired displayed Web page.
</p>

<p>
Cloudflare does not seem to support Brotli compression (br)
even on HTML even when covered by "Cache Everything".
</p>

<p>
The images had already been manually roughly halved in size earlier.
</p>

<p>
A typical (unencrypted) HTTP/1.1 view gets lots of A scores, start
render in 284ms and visually complete in 400ms, with a total transfer
size of 13kB.  All 4 objects (and the attempt to fetch the non-existant
favicon.ico) were fetched over two TCP connections.

The first/main HTML transfer looked like (including ~94ms of TLS setup):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Request Start: 0.236 s</li>
<li>Initial Connection: 54 ms</li>
<li>Time to First Byte: 78 ms</li>
<li>Content Download: 13 ms</li>
<li>Bytes In (downloaded): 3.5 KB</li>
<li>Uncompressed Size: 9.5 KB</li>
<li>Certificates (downloaded): 3,757 B</li>
<li>Bytes Out (uploaded): 0.2 KB</li>
</ul>

<p>
So with this simple page HTTP/2 saved one TCP connection but
<strong>nearly doubled data transfered and time to display</strong>
compared the the HTTP/1.1 version from the same world-class CDN server,
and indeed from my own RPi!  All the render times were entirely
acceptable, but the https overhead is clear.
</p>


<h2>Fully Loaded Page HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2</h2>

<p>
This page has 3 AdSense 'responsive' ads on it.
</p>

<p>
For HTTP/1.1 the page content is visible in ~500ms and the page
including ads is visually complete in 3.1s, with a speed index of 1716
and a total page weight including certificates of ~340kB.
9 TCP connections were used.
</p>

<p>
For HTTP/2 the page content is visible in ~600ms and the page
including ads is visually complete in 3.0s, with a speed index of 2115+
and a total page weight including certificates of ~385kB+.
6 TCP connections were used.
</p>

<p>
So HTTP/2 still performs slightly worse than HTTP/1.1 from a user perspective,
and though it saves some TCP connections HTTP/2 uses more data.
Putting AdSense on the page largely swamps everything else.
</p>

<p>
It is probably reasonable to assume that Cloudflare's HTTP servers are
well tuned; thus at the moment all I see is a minor detriment to the
user experience and possibly to their and my carbon footprint from extra
traffic from switching to HTTP/2.
</p>

<p>
Effectively compulsory use of TLS/https with HTTP/2 prevents <em>helpful</em>
intermediaries from cacheing, transcoding, etc, which has scalability
concerns for places further from the Web servers and with poor bandwidth,
such as mobile use and the developing world.  And the extra RTTs and
opportunity for breakage on mobile hurt TLS/https even more.
</p>

<p>
A big advantage of a CDN, when using HTTP/2 and thus https,
is that the time for any extra round-trips during handshaking
is reduced, thus reducing latency and improving user experience,
especially for the the first page fetched.
</p>

<h2>Playtime</h2>

<p>
2017/05/16:
as a side-side-project I've tried pushing some of the static content
from this (Earth Notes) site into the Cloudflare hosted site to see
what benefits may accrue from a more subtle blend of hosting locally
and quietly moving some stuff to the cloud.
</p>

<p>
In particular (and this isn't probably isn't a good idea for SEO purposes,
I've mirrored my static images directory within the Cloudflare site.
I've set those items up to have a long expiry, and with Cache-Control
marked 'public' and '<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control">immutable</a>',
and redirected key items needed during page loading to the Cloudflare site.
</p>

<p>
(A normal page reload is able to avoid reloading at least one 'immutable'
item with Firefox.)
</p>

<p>
Typically the front page first load from a clean cache
(via http:// in either desktop or mobile versions)
takes three connections, one of which is an HTTP/2 (over TLS)
connection to Cloudflare which scoops up several immutable items.
</p>

<p>
Note that because of the nature of the site, most page views are the
first and only page view of the site for a given user.  Thus it makes
sense to concentrate on optimising that first view with an empty cache
(ie minimising latency), even at some cost in cacheing for nominal
subsequent page views.  So, for example, inlining small amounts of core
CSS is a win definitely for HTTP/1.1, and even quite likely for HTTP/2.
</p>

<p>
Pages are typically rendered in just over a second even over simulated 3G.
</p>

<p>
The trial policy is to explicitly link only to the mirrored versions
of the static items from <code>img</code> tags for example,
that happen implicitly as part of (and that could delay) page loading,
but to leave any explicit click-through links pointing to 'normal'
canonical earth.org.uk addresses.  I can simply check in the logs
for actual likely best wins in terms of hits on files under /img/
hit from pages on site.
</p>

<!--  egrep '^www.earth.*"GET /img/.* "http://((m)|(www)).earth.*.html' LOG | egrep -v ' LOCALIP' | awk '{print $8}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n  -->

Cloudflare has enough distinct edge servers (&gt;100 at 2017/05) that
it could take a long time to populate all of them for global traffic
individually without using their tiered/hierarchical 'Argo' service
for example.  So my site will continue to see hits, and end users see
slow cache misses.  It may indeed be hard to keep the less-frequent
geographies' edge caches live at all, and at ~2017/05/22 I can see this
whenever a user from a 'new' country pops up.  Thus the Cloudflare hit
rate is typically somewhere in the range 50--70% overall.

2017/05/26:
I have managed to tweak things such that for the desktop front page
all objects are delivered in parallel down two connections for a new visitor:
4 down the initial HTTP/1.1 connection from index.html to favicon.ico,
and 5 via Cloudflare over HTTP/2, with first render in 655ms (speed index 750)
and complete in ~1.5s with a total weight (including certs) of 51kB.
(For mobile an extra connection is used even though only 5 objects transferred.)
</p>

<p>
2017/05/31:
with more tweaking, including better handling of JavaScript and the
extra CSS used on the home page, mobile (m) and desktop (www) home pages
are essentially visually complete in 0.5s and ~1s respectively, with 5
objects, 2 connections and 17kB for mobile cf 8 objects, 3 connections
and 46kB for desktop.

2017/06/17:
a few days ago I switched back to serving all static content directly
from the RPi (from the 'main'/www URL), not via the CDN.  I haven't
turned off the aliases via the CDN, and some spider requests are still
coming though, but that's not a problem.
</p>


<h2>Carbon</h2>

<p>
Given some estimates (see Sources) for sending 11g--19g per 1MB of
data across the Internet (in one case across 3G, in another for email)
we might reasonably start from an estimate of 10g/1MB, so maybe ~0.1g
to visit the ad-free page over HTTP/1.1, ~0.2g over HTTP/2 with https,
rising to ~3.4g with ads, and to ~3.9g with ads and over HTTP/2 with https.
This does not account for distance (byte miles?) for traffic,
nor many other factors.
</p>

<p>
Also to be accounted for are any differences in serving from efficient CDN
servers (assumed more efficient than my RPi, even if it is running off-grid)
closer to the end user (reduced byte miles), and less obvious effects such
as any extra costs of (eg) handling uncached traffic such as 404s from
robots.txt and malicious probe request 404s now taking a longer route.
</p>

<p>
Note also that objects from very lightly-used sites may be continually
be evicted from CDN caches, thus requiring extra work to refetch them
every time (or nearly so) that they are requested, possibly doubling
traffic and CPU effort to deliver to the end user.
Though it is also possible that some indirect uncached routes via a CDN
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo/">are faster and more efficient</a>
than directly.
</p>

<p>
<strong>IN PROGRESS</strong>
